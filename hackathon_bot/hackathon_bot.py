"""The main module for the hackathon bot.

This module contains the main class for the hackathon bot.

Classes
-------
HackathonBot
    Represents the hackathon bot.

Examples
--------
To run the hackathon bot, create a new class that inherits
from the `HackathonBot` class and implement the required methods.
Then, create an instance of the bot and run it using the `run` method.

        This method can be overridden to perform any action while the game

        While this method is running, the server waits for it to complete before
        finishing the game start process. Therefore, it is recommended to keep
        this method as short as possible.
